## Problem Statement
<p align = "justify">Every alternate day we hear news about person missing. Many of these include blind person who canâ€™t tell
the whereabouts when they gone missing. Some of these blind people are never traced. However, with the
use of the advanced GPS blind person tracker system, family members can find blind person in few minutes.
GPS based tracker for blind person project solves this problem. This project has GPS modem and GSM
modem and it sends SMS to the family members of the Blind person which contains the Longitude and
Latitude of the person. This project is scalable; it can also be used for tracking senior citizens or people who
are partially blind.
This project also has 4 pushbuttons. 3 buttons can be used by visually impaired person to send emergency messages to the family members with respective 3 emergency messages. GPS modem continuously
sends data string to the Microcontroller. It includes Longitude Latitude of the place where project is currently situated. Thus Microcontroller gets co-ordinates of the place. The 4th button is connected to the
buzzer. When the person wants to alert people around him if he comes across a dangerous situation, he
could press the button and the buzzer will emit sound.</p>

## Scope of the Project 

<p align = "justify">This project can be implemented for current use as it uses rapidly growing and reliable wireless technology.
It can be easily used for tracking people who are visually impaired. It can be used to attend to sensitive
matters like emergencies, medical attention, as soon as possible without any delays.</p>

## Features of the Project
<p align = "justify"> 
1. GPS modem and GSM modem which sends SMS to the family members of the Blind person which
contains the Longitude and Latitude of the person.<br><br>
2. It has 4 pushbuttons. 3 buttons can be used by visually impaired person to send emergency messages
to the family members with respective 3 emergency messages.<br><br>
3. The 4th button is connected to the buzzer to alert the nearby people.<br><br>

## Conclusion and Future Scope

<p align = "justify">

We were able to successfully implement our idea and track visually impaired people using this project. It
proved to be very handy and easy to use for the visually impaired. Our aims and objectives were met, and
were able to successfully simulate the project. Every module was working as intented. For future work we can explore the following untouched regions:

1. It is easily scalable and more features can be added to it.<br><br>
2. Other sensors such as the distance sensor, infrared sensor, etc can be added to it and object detection
can be done.<br><br>
3. Other advanced features can be implemented for the easy of the visually impaired person.<br><br>
4. It can be used for general tracking in security purposes.<br><br>
